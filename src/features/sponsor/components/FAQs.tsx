    question: 'Who qualifies to be a sponsor?',
    answer: `Any team or project that is building in the Web3 ecosystem can sponsor a listing on CoDesign. Size of the team or operations don't matter â€” you can be a tokenised project or a small grantee; as long as you are building on the Solana blockchain, you can add a listing on CoDesign.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'How much money do I need to put up?',
    answer: `There is no upper or lower limit of the amount of money you need to put up per listing. However, the compensation offered per listing will affect the distribution (via emails, discord, platform discovery, etc.) that the listing will get.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Who judges the bounties & projects?',
    answer: `The sponsors are supposed to review, announce, and pay out the winners on CoDesign. It's super simple to manage your submissions, all within CoDesign.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Are there any hidden costs and charges?',
    answer: `None at all!`,
  },
  {
    question: 'What can I use CoDesign for?',
    answer: `CoDesign is a platform to get work done from crypto-native talent. This can be in the form of boutnies (get the same work done by many people) or hiring freelancers in the form of Project listings.
<br />
CoDesign can be used to get any small to medium scale task done, including but not limited to development, writing, design, research, and product feedback.
